# CLAUDE.md

Single source of truth: **AGENTS.md**

Read and follow **AGENTS.md** first (repo conventions, commands, CI requirements).

If AGENTS.md conflicts with other docs, prefer:

1. AGENTS.md
2. `dev-plans/mvp-plan-final.md` (product context and architecture)
3. README.md
4. app/package-level docs under `apps/*` or `packages/*`
